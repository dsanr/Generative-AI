      " | Once you’ve identified several strategic goals, determine which are worth pursuing. To set the stage, ensure everyone is aware of the purpose behind each goal. This calls back to Henderson’s point that employees’ alignment on purpose can set your organization up to outperform its competitors. | An estimate can be a valuable piece of information when deciding which goals to pursue. Although not all strategic goals need to yield a high return on investment, it’s in your best interest to calculate each objective’s anticipated ROI so you can compare them. 2. Consider Current Events When deciding which strategic goal to prioritize, you can’t overlook the importance of the present moment. What’s happening in the world that could impact the timeliness of each goal?\n",
      " | --- | ---\n",
      " | 1. Calculating the estimated return on investment (ROI) of the operational goals tied to each strategic objective can provide a useful estimate for decision-making. For example, if your strategic goal is “reach carbon-neutral status by 2030,” you need to break that down into actionable sub-tasks—such as “determine how much CO2 our company produces each year” and “craft a marketing and public relations strategy”— and calculate the expected cost and return for each. | For example, in 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the ever-intensifying climate change crisis impacted many organizations’ strategic goals. Often, the goals that are timely and pressing are those that earn priority.\n",

      "\n",
      "Keys to Successful Strategy Formulation > 1. Start with Purpose\n",
      "When setting out to create a winning strategy, the first question to ask yourself is, “What’s my organization’s purpose?”\n",

      "“We see this pattern in a wide range of firms,” Henderson says.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Keys to Successful Strategy Formulation > 1. Start with Purpose\n",
      "One example of a company that formulated its strategy using purpose is Unilever’s Lipton brand.\n",
      "“It started with the feeling that, for communities, we could do a better job,” says Kevin Havelock, president of refreshment at Unilever, in Sustainable Business Strategy.\n",
      "“It didn’t start with the business case.\n",

      "Business doesn’t exist in a vacuum—it’s influenced by politics, policies, laws, and relationships between countries.\n",

      "What Is Strategic Planning and Why Is It Important?\n",
      "Before diving into the specifics of crafting a business strategy, it’s important to understand what the strategic planning process is and how it can benefit your organization.\n",
      "What Is Strategic Planning?\n",
      "Strategic planning is the ongoing organizational process of using available knowledge to document a business’s intended direction.\n",
      "This process is used to prioritize efforts, effectively allocate resources, align shareholders and employees on goals, and ensure those goals are backed by data and sound reasoning.\n",
      "How Can Strategic Planning Benefit My Organization?\n",
      "Strategic planning requires time, effort, and continual reassessment.\n",
      "Given the proper attention, it can set your business on the right track.\n",
      "Here are three ways strategic planning can benefit your firm.\n",
      "1. Creates One, Forward-Focused Vision\n",
      "One significant benefit of strategic planning is that it creates a single, forward-focused vision that aligns your company’s employees and shareholders.\n",
      "By making everyone aware of your company’s goals, how and why you chose those goals, and what they can do to help reach them, you can create an increased sense of responsibility throughout your organization.\n",
      "This can also have trickle-down effects.\n",
      "For instance, if a manager isn’t clear on your organization’s strategy or the reasoning used to craft it, they could make decisions that counteract it.\n",
      "With one vision to unite around, everyone at your organization can act with a broader strategy in mind.\n",
      "What Is Strategic Planning and Why Is It Important?\n",
      "3. Tracks Progress Based on Strategic Goals\n",
      "Having a strategic plan in place enables you to track progress toward goals.\n",
      "When each department and team understands your company’s larger strategy, their progress can directly impact its success, creating a top-down approach to tracking key performance indicators (KPIs).\n",
      "By planning your company’s strategy and defining its goals, you can determine KPIs at the organizational level.\n",
      "Those goals can then be extended to business units, departments, teams, and individuals.\n",
      "This ensures every level of your organization is aligned and can positively impact your business’s KPIs and performance.\n",
      "Remember: Although your strategy might be far-reaching and structured, it must remain agile.\n",
      "As HBS Professor Clayton Christensen asserts in Disruptive Strategy, a business’s strategy needs to evolve with the challenges and opportunities it encounters.\n",
      "Be prepared to pivot your KPIs as goals shift and communicate reasons for change to your organization.\n",
      "2. Draws Attention to Biases and Flaws in Reasoning\n",
      "The decisions you make come with inherent bias.\n",
      "Taking part in the strategic planning process forces you to examine and explain why you’re making each decision and back it up with data, projections, or case studies, thus combatting your cognitive biases.\n",
      "A few examples of cognitive biases are:\n",
      "• The recency effect: The tendency to select the option presented most recently because it’s fresh in your mind\n",
      "• Occam’s razor bias: The tendency to assume the most obvious decision to be the best decision\n",
      "• Inertia bias: The tendency to select options that allow you to think, feel, and act in familiar ways\n",
      "• Confirmation bias: The tendency to only pay attention to information that supports your viewpoint\n",
      "If you’re crafting a strategic plan for your organization and know which strategy you prefer, enlist others with differing views and opinions to help look for information that either proves or disproves the idea.\n",
      "Combating biases in strategic decision-making requires effort and dedication from your entire team and can make your organization’s strategy that much stronger.\n",
      "To craft a strategic plan for your organization and reap these benefits, you first need to determine the goals you’re trying to reach.\n",
      "The next section will dive into how to craft and prioritize strategic goals.\n",
      "What Is Strategic Planning and Why Is It Important?\n",
      "Setting and Prioritizing Strategic Goals\n",
      "In an ever-changing business world, it’s imperative to have strategic goals and a plan to guide organizational efforts.\n",
      "Yet, crafting strategic goals can be a daunting task.\n",
      "How do you decide which goals are vital to your company?\n",
      "Which are actionable and measurable?\n",
      "Which do you prioritize?\n",
      "To help answer these questions, here’s a breakdown of what characterizes strong strategic goals and how to select which to pursue.\n",
      "Characteristics of Strong Strategic Goals\n",
      "Strategic goals are an organization’s measurable objectives that indicate its long- term vision.\n",
      "Here are four characteristics of strategic goals you should apply.\n",
      "1. Purpose-Driven\n",
      "A strong strategic goal is driven by purpose.\n",
      "What are you striving for, and why is it important to set objectives?\n",
      "What impact do you hope to have on profit, your community, and the environment?\n",
      "Develop and select goals that are guided by the answers to these questions.\n",
      "“You don’t have to leave your values at the door when you come to work,” says HBS Professor Rebecca Henderson in the online course Sustainable Business Strategy.\n",
      "Henderson, whose work focuses on reimagining capitalism for a just and sustainable world, explains that leading with purpose can drive business performance.\n",
      "“Adopting a purpose will not hurt your performance if you do it authentically and well,” Henderson says in a lecture streamed via Facebook Live.\n",
      "“If you’re able to link your purpose to the strategic vision of the company in a way that really gets people aligned and facing in the right direction, then you have the possibility of outperforming your competitors.”\n",
      "Setting and Prioritizing Strategic Goals\n",
      "“The course has completely changed me.\n",
      "I feel like a new person—with a new thought process driven by purpose—committed to doing the right thing.\n",
      "I have a purpose today that’s in line with my values.\n",
      "I’ve joined forums and groups and met people who share my thought process.”\n",
      "Mayank Dubey\n",
      "Sustainable Business Strategy Participant\n",
      "2. Long-Term\n",
      "When setting strategic goals, think of your company’s values and long-term vision and ensure you’re not confusing strategic goals with operational goals.\n",
      "While strategic goals are your organization’s long-term objectives, operational goals are the daily milestones you need to reach to achieve them.\n",
      "For instance, your organization’s goal could be to create a new marketing strategy; however, this is an operational goal in service of a long-term vision.\n",
      "In this case, the strategic goal could be breaking into a new market segment, to which the creation of a new marketing strategy would contribute.\n",
      "Keep a forward-focused vision to ensure you’re setting challenging objectives that can have a lasting impact on your company.\n",
      "3. Actionable\n",
      "Strong strategic goals aren’t only long-term and forward- focused—they’re actionable.\n",
      "If there aren’t operational goals your team can complete to reach the strategic goal, your organization is better off spending time and resources elsewhere.\n",
      "When formulating strategic goals, think about the operational goals that fall under them.\n",
      "Are they actionable steps your team can take to achieve your organization’s objective?\n",
      "If so, the goal could be a worthwhile endeavor.\n",
      "Setting and Prioritizing Strategic Goals\n",
      "4. Measurable\n",
      "When crafting strategic goals, define how progress and success will be measured.\n",
      "For instance, the goal “become a household name” is valid but vague.\n",
      "Consider the intended timeframe to reach this goal and how you’ll operationally define “a household name.”\n",
      "The method of obtaining data must also be taken into account.\n",
      "An appropriate revision to the original goal could be: “Increase brand recognition by 80 percent among surveyed Americans by 2030.”\n",
      "By setting a more specific goal, you can better equip your organization to reach it and ensure employees and shareholders have a clear definition of success and how it will be measured.\n",
      "How to Assess Goals for Prioritization\n",
      " | Once you’ve identified several strategic goals, determine which are worth pursuing. To set the stage, ensure everyone is aware of the purpose behind each goal. This calls back to Henderson’s point that employees’ alignment on purpose can set your organization up to outperform its competitors. | An estimate can be a valuable piece of information when deciding which goals to pursue. Although not all strategic goals need to yield a high return on investment, it’s in your best interest to calculate each objective’s anticipated ROI so you can compare them. 2. Consider Current Events When deciding which strategic goal to prioritize, you can’t overlook the importance of the present moment. What’s happening in the world that could impact the timeliness of each goal?\n",
      " | --- | ---\n",
      " | 1. Calculating the estimated return on investment (ROI) of the operational goals tied to each strategic objective can provide a useful estimate for decision-making. For example, if your strategic goal is “reach carbon-neutral status by 2030,” you need to break that down into actionable sub-tasks—such as “determine how much CO2 our company produces each year” and “craft a marketing and public relations strategy”— and calculate the expected cost and return for each. | For example, in 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the ever-intensifying climate change crisis impacted many organizations’ strategic goals. Often, the goals that are timely and pressing are those that earn priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ROI formula is typically written as:\n",
      "ROI = (NET PROFIT / COST OF INVESTMENT) X 100\n",
      "In project management, the formula uses slightly different terms:\n",
      "ROI = [(FINANCIAL VALUE - PROJECT COST) / PROJECT COST] X 100\n",
      "Setting and Prioritizing Strategic Goals\n",
      "After determining your organization’s prioritized goals, you can begin formulating a strategy to reach them.\n",
      "The next section will outline several factors to consider when crafting a business strategy.\n",

      "How Can Strategic Planning Benefit My Organization?\n",
      "Strategic planning requires time, effort, and continual reassessment.\n",
      "Given the proper attention, it can set your business on the right track.\n",
      "Here are three ways strategic planning can benefit your firm.\n",
      "1. Creates One, Forward-Focused Vision\n",
      "One significant benefit of strategic planning is that it creates a single, forward-focused vision that aligns your company’s employees and shareholders.\n",
      "By making everyone aware of your company’s goals, how and why you chose those goals, and what they can do to help reach them, you can create an increased sense of responsibility throughout your organization.\n",
      "This can also have trickle-down effects.\n",
      "For instance, if a manager isn’t clear on your organization’s strategy or the reasoning used to craft it, they could make decisions that counteract it.\n",
      "With one vision to unite around, everyone at your organization can act with a broader strategy in mind.\n",
      "What Is Strategic Planning and Why Is It Important?\n",
      "3. Tracks Progress Based on Strategic Goals\n",
      "Having a strategic plan in place enables you to track progress toward goals.\n",
      "When each department and team understands your company’s larger strategy, their progress can directly impact its success, creating a top-down approach to tracking key performance indicators (KPIs).\n",
      "By planning your company’s strategy and defining its goals, you can determine KPIs at the organizational level.\n",
      "Those goals can then be extended to business units, departments, teams, and individuals.\n",
      "This ensures every level of your organization is aligned and can positively impact your business’s KPIs and performance.\n",
      "Remember: Although your strategy might be far-reaching and structured, it must remain agile.\n",
      "As HBS Professor Clayton Christensen asserts in Disruptive Strategy, a business’s strategy needs to evolve with the challenges and opportunities it encounters.\n",
      "Be prepared to pivot your KPIs as goals shift and communicate reasons for change to your organization.\n",
      "2. Draws Attention to Biases and Flaws in Reasoning\n",
      "The decisions you make come with inherent bias.\n",
      "Taking part in the strategic planning process forces you to examine and explain why you’re making each decision and back it up with data, projections, or case studies, thus combatting your cognitive biases.\n",
      "A few examples of cognitive biases are:\n",
      "• The recency effect: The tendency to select the option presented most recently because it’s fresh in your mind\n",
      "• Occam’s razor bias: The tendency to assume the most obvious decision to be the best decision\n",
      "• Inertia bias: The tendency to select options that allow you to think, feel, and act in familiar ways\n",
      "• Confirmation bias: The tendency to only pay attention to information that supports your viewpoint\n",
      "If you’re crafting a strategic plan for your organization and know which strategy you prefer, enlist others with differing views and opinions to help look for information that either proves or disproves the idea.\n",
      "Combating biases in strategic decision-making requires effort and dedication from your entire team and can make your organization’s strategy that much stronger.\n",
      "To craft a strategic plan for your organization and reap these benefits, you first need to determine the goals you’re trying to reach.\n",

      "Setting and Prioritizing Strategic Goals\n",
      "In an ever-changing business world, it’s imperative to have strategic goals and a plan to guide organizational efforts.\n",
      "Yet, crafting strategic goals can be a daunting task.\n",
      "How do you decide which goals are vital to your company?\n",
      "Which are actionable and measurable?\n",
      "Which do you prioritize?\n",
      "To help answer these questions, here’s a breakdown of what characterizes strong strategic goals and how to select which to pursue.\n",
      "Characteristics of Strong Strategic Goals\n",
      "Strategic goals are an organization’s measurable objectives that indicate its long- term vision.\n",
      "Here are four characteristics of strategic goals you should apply.\n",
      "1. Purpose-Driven\n",
      "A strong strategic goal is driven by purpose.\n",
      "What are you striving for, and why is it important to set objectives?\n",
      "What impact do you hope to have on profit, your community, and the environment?\n",
      "Develop and select goals that are guided by the answers to these questions.\n",
      "“You don’t have to leave your values at the door when you come to work,” says HBS Professor Rebecca Henderson in the online course Sustainable Business Strategy.\n",
      "Henderson, whose work focuses on reimagining capitalism for a just and sustainable world, explains that leading with purpose can drive business performance.\n",
      "“Adopting a purpose will not hurt your performance if you do it authentically and well,” Henderson says in a lecture streamed via Facebook Live.\n",
      "“If you’re able to link your purpose to the strategic vision of the company in a way that really gets people aligned and facing in the right direction, then you have the possibility of outperforming your competitors.”\n",
      "Setting and Prioritizing Strategic Goals\n",
      "“The course has completely changed me.\n",
      "I feel like a new person—with a new thought process driven by purpose—committed to doing the right thing.\n",
      "I have a purpose today that’s in line with my values.\n",
      "I’ve joined forums and groups and met people who share my thought process.”\n",
      "Mayank Dubey\n",
      "Sustainable Business Strategy Participant\n",
      "2. Long-Term\n",
      "When setting strategic goals, think of your company’s values and long-term vision and ensure you’re not confusing strategic goals with operational goals.\n",
      "While strategic goals are your organization’s long-term objectives, operational goals are the daily milestones you need to reach to achieve them.\n",
      "For instance, your organization’s goal could be to create a new marketing strategy; however, this is an operational goal in service of a long-term vision.\n",
      "In this case, the strategic goal could be breaking into a new market segment, to which the creation of a new marketing strategy would contribute.\n",
      "Keep a forward-focused vision to ensure you’re setting challenging objectives that can have a lasting impact on your company.\n",
      "3. Actionable\n",
      "Strong strategic goals aren’t only long-term and forward- focused—they’re actionable.\n",
      "If there aren’t operational goals your team can complete to reach the strategic goal, your organization is better off spending time and resources elsewhere.\n",
      "When formulating strategic goals, think about the operational goals that fall under them.\n",
      "Are they actionable steps your team can take to achieve your organization’s objective?\n",
      "If so, the goal could be a worthwhile endeavor.\n",
      "Setting and Prioritizing Strategic Goals\n",
      "4. Measurable\n",
      "When crafting strategic goals, define how progress and success will be measured.\n",
      "For instance, the goal “become a household name” is valid but vague.\n",
      "Consider the intended timeframe to reach this goal and how you’ll operationally define “a household name.”\n",
      "The method of obtaining data must also be taken into account.\n",
      "An appropriate revision to the original goal could be: “Increase brand recognition by 80 percent among surveyed Americans by 2030.”\n",
      "By setting a more specific goal, you can better equip your organization to reach it and ensure employees and shareholders have a clear definition of success and how it will be measured.\n",
      "How to Assess Goals for Prioritization\n",
      " | Once you’ve identified several strategic goals, determine which are worth pursuing. To set the stage, ensure everyone is aware of the purpose behind each goal. This calls back to Henderson’s point that employees’ alignment on purpose can set your organization up to outperform its competitors. | An estimate can be a valuable piece of information when deciding which goals to pursue. Although not all strategic goals need to yield a high return on investment, it’s in your best interest to calculate each objective’s anticipated ROI so you can compare them. 2. Consider Current Events When deciding which strategic goal to prioritize, you can’t overlook the importance of the present moment. What’s happening in the world that could impact the timeliness of each goal?\n",
      " | --- | ---\n",
      " | 1. Calculating the estimated return on investment (ROI) of the operational goals tied to each strategic objective can provide a useful estimate for decision-making. For example, if your strategic goal is “reach carbon-neutral status by 2030,” you need to break that down into actionable sub-tasks—such as “determine how much CO2 our company produces each year” and “craft a marketing and public relations strategy”— and calculate the expected cost and return for each. | For example, in 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the ever-intensifying climate change crisis impacted many organizations’ strategic goals. Often, the goals that are timely and pressing are those that earn priority.\n",

      "Formulating a strong strategy doesn’t need to be daunting or difficult.\n",
      "Here are five factors to consider for successful strategy formulation.\n",
      "1. Start with Purpose\n",
      "When setting out to create a winning strategy, the first question to ask yourself is, “What’s my organization’s purpose?”\n",
      "In Sustainable Business Strategy, Henderson discusses the importance of starting with purpose when building your business strategy.\n",
      "“We see this pattern in a wide range of firms,” Henderson says.\n",
      "“The leaders and firms who are driving real change and often reaping the benefits of being first-movers are motivated as often by the driving desire to make a difference as they are to make money.”\n",
      "One example of a company that formulated its strategy using purpose is Unilever’s Lipton brand.\n",
      "“It started with the feeling that, for communities, we could do a better job,” says Kevin Havelock, president of refreshment at Unilever, in Sustainable Business Strategy.\n",
      "“It didn’t start with the business case.\n",
      "We then said, ‘Hang on—how do we bring this to life?’\n",
      "If it’s the right thing to do for these people and for the planet, then we should bring it to life for the brands.”\n",
      "Instead of jumping into logistics, Unilever put its values and mission of producing sustainable tea at the center of its strategy development, enabling it to take steps to reach that vision.\n",
      "Henderson notes that this intersection of “doing good” and “doing well”—often referred to as the process of creating shared value—has the potential to be a highly lucrative space.\n",
      "FORMULATION FRAMEWORK\n",
      "The Triple Bottom Line\n",
      "The triple bottom line is a business concept that posits firms should commit to measuring their social and environmental impact—in addition to their financial performance—rather than solely focusing on generating profit, or the standard “bottom line.”\n",
      "It can be broken down into “three Ps”: profit, people, and the planet.\n",
      "PROFIT\n",
      "refers to the financial return a company generates for its shareholders.\n",
      " | PEOPLE | PLANET\n",
      " | --- | ---\n",
      " | refers to a company’s commitment to making a societal impact in communities locally and abroad. | refers to the impact an organization makes on the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider Global Events\n",
      "Business doesn’t exist in a vacuum—it’s influenced by politics, policies, laws, and relationships between countries.\n",
      "Because those relationships can be extremely nuanced, it’s important to closely follow news related to countries where you do business and consider global events as you formulate a strategy.\n",
      "Political leaders’ decisions can impact taxes, labor laws, raw material costs, transportation infrastructure, and educational systems.\n",
      "One hypothetical example presented by HBS Professor Forest Reinhardt in Global Business is that if the Chinese government decided to subsidize Chinese dairy farms, it would impact dairy farmers in all surrounding countries.\n",
      "This is because, with extra funding, Chinese dairy farms may produce a surplus of dairy products, causing them to expand their markets to neighboring countries.\n",
      "If you’re crafting a strategy for your Mongolia-based dairy business, this dynamic is important to consider.\n",
      "It’s both exciting and intimidating that the nuances of international politics, policies, and relations can impact your business.\n",
      "Stay informed and incorporate new knowledge into your strategic planning process as it arises.\n",
      "3. Examine Data, Case Studies, and Trends\n",
      "In addition to current global events, a successful strategy must take into account the information and knowledge you have about your organization, other firms, and fundamental theories of economics.\n",
      "Understanding this information enables you to orient your company in the business landscape and learn from others’ mistakes and successes.\n",
      "“As you think about going out into the world and using these tools of experimentation, the first thing is to think of yourself as an experimenter,” says Nava Ashraf, an associate professor at HBS who’s featured in the online course Economics for Managers.\n",
      "“Change your mindset of what it actually means to look for data from the world that helps you know whether something works or doesn’t work.”\n",
      "When crafting your strategy, examine your organization’s financial statements, along with historical strategies that have been successful and unsuccessful.\n",
      "Also, analyze case studies of other businesses and the economic principles that underlie them.\n",
      "FORMULATION FRAMEWORK\n",
      "The Value Stick and Value-Based Pricing\n",
      "Value-based pricing is a means of price-setting wherein a company primarily relies on its customers’ perceived value of goods or services being sold—also known as customers’ willingness to pay (WTP)—to determine the price it will charge.\n",
      "Because it revolves around customers’ priorities, it’s occasionally called customer-focused pricing.\n",
      "When crafting a value-based pricing strategy, one framework to keep on hand is the value stick.\n",
      "The value stick comprises four components: willingness to pay, price, cost, and willingness to sell (WTS).\n",
      "Where on the stick each of these points falls determines how a sale’s value is split between a firm, its customers, and its suppliers.\n",
      "Picturing each of these factors as sliders on a stick enables you to test out different scenarios and aid in strategic decision-making.\n",
      "If you lower the production cost, will the customer’s willingness to pay decrease?\n",
      "If you raise the production cost and price, will the customer’s willingness to pay increase?\n",
      "If so, is it worth it?\n",
      "Understanding the relationship between the supplier, business, and customer, and how each entity gains value from your product, is an important exercise during strategy formulation.\n",
      "FACULTY INSIGHT\n",
      "“As strategists, we really ask three questions: How can my business best create value for customers?\n",
      "How can my business create value for employees?\n",
      "And how can my business create value by collaborating with suppliers?\n",
      "Think of a company’s strategy as an answer to these three questions.”\n",
      "HBS Professor Felix Oberholzer-Gee\n",
      "in Business Strategy\n",
      "4. Set and Effectively Communicate Goals\n",
      "As discussed in the previous section, selecting strategic goals is an important step of strategy formulation.\n",
      "Just as important is the ability to effectively communicate those goals to your organization.\n",
      "Research outlined in the Harvard Business Review shows that, on average, 95 percent of employees don’t understand their company’s strategy—a staggering statistic, considering that successful strategy execution requires organization-wide effort.\n",
      "Crafting a strategy is crucial, but it can’t be successful unless it’s effectively and artfully communicated to all employees so they feel empowered and responsible for reaching the company’s goals.\n",
      "5. Think of Strategy as an Ongoing Process\n",
      "Once you’ve formulated and communicated a strategic plan, it can be tempting to assume the strategic planning process is complete.\n",
      "According to HBS Professor Clayton Christensen, strategy is a continual process of development.\n",
      "In the online course Disruptive Strategy, Christensen notes that in a study of HBS graduates who started businesses, 93 percent of those with successful strategies evolved and pivoted away from their original strategic plans.\n",
      "“Most people think of strategy as an event, but that’s not the way the world works,” Christensen says.\n",
      "“When we run into unanticipated opportunities and threats, we have to respond.\n",
      "Sometimes we respond successfully; sometimes, we don’t. But most strategies develop through this process.\n",
      "More often than not, the strategy that leads to success emerges through a process that’s at work 24/7 in almost every industry.”\n",
      "Periodically reassess your company’s strategy to adapt to new challenges and opportunities and continue communicating its evolution to your broader organization.\n",
      "FORMULATION FRAMEWORK\n",
      "The formulation of your strategy must constantly evolve—and so must your strategic skill set.\n",
      "The next section will explore how to select a business strategy course that’s right for your needs and strategic focus.\n",
      "Disruptive Innovation\n",
      "Disruptive innovation, a term coined by Christensen, is the process by which a smaller company—usually with fewer resources—moves upmarket and challenges larger, established businesses.\n",
      "The process begins with a small company entering the low end of a market (low-end disruption) or creating a new market segment (new-market disruption) and claiming the least profitable portion as its own.\n",
      "Because the established, incumbent companies own the most profitable segments, they most likely won’t fight the entrant for that market share.\n",
      "The entrant then improves its offerings and moves upmarket with increasing profitability.\n",
      "Once the incumbents’ customers have widely adopted the entrant’s offerings in the mainstream market, disruption has occurred.\n",
      "Understanding the disruptive innovation framework can empower you to create a strategy for disrupting an industry or avoiding disruption.\n",

      "4. Set and Effectively Communicate Goals\n",
      "As discussed in the previous section, selecting strategic goals is an important step of strategy formulation.\n",
      "Just as important is the ability to effectively communicate those goals to your organization.\n",
      "Research outlined in the Harvard Business Review shows that, on average, 95 percent of employees don’t understand their company’s strategy—a staggering statistic, considering that successful strategy execution requires organization-wide effort.\n",
      "Crafting a strategy is crucial, but it can’t be successful unless it’s effectively and artfully communicated to all employees so they feel empowered and responsible for reaching the company’s goals.\n",

      "Once you’ve formulated and communicated a strategic plan, it can be tempting to assume the strategic planning process is complete.\n",
      "According to HBS Professor Clayton Christensen, strategy is a continual process of development.\n",
      "In the online course Disruptive Strategy, Christensen notes that in a study of HBS graduates who started businesses, 93 percent of those with successful strategies evolved and pivoted away from their original strategic plans.\n",
      "“Most people think of strategy as an event, but that’s not the way the world works,” Christensen says.\n",
      "“When we run into unanticipated opportunities and threats, we have to respond.\n",
      "Sometimes we respond successfully; sometimes, we don’t. But most strategies develop through this process.\n",
      "More often than not, the strategy that leads to success emerges through a process that’s at work 24/7 in almost every industry.”\n",
      "Periodically reassess your company’s strategy to adapt to new challenges and opportunities and continue communicating its evolution to your broader organization.\n",
      "FORMULATION FRAMEWORK\n",
      "The formulation of your strategy must constantly evolve—and so must your strategic skill set.\n",
      "The next section will explore how to select a business strategy course that’s right for your needs and strategic focus.\n",
      "Disruptive Innovation\n",
      "Disruptive innovation, a term coined by Christensen, is the process by which a smaller company—usually with fewer resources—moves upmarket and challenges larger, established businesses.\n",
      "The process begins with a small company entering the low end of a market (low-end disruption) or creating a new market segment (new-market disruption) and claiming the least profitable portion as its own.\n",
      "Because the established, incumbent companies own the most profitable segments, they most likely won’t fight the entrant for that market share.\n",
      "The entrant then improves its offerings and moves upmarket with increasing profitability.\n",
      "Once the incumbents’ customers have widely adopted the entrant’s offerings in the mainstream market, disruption has occurred.\n",
      "Understanding the disruptive innovation framework can empower you to create a strategy for disrupting an industry or avoiding disruption.\n",
